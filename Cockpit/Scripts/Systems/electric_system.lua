notes about A-4E electrical system from NATOPS page 1-24 onwards:

Electrical power is normally supplied by a 10-kva,
engine-driven generator, which furnishes 115/ 200vac,
3-phase, 400-cycle, constant frequency ac
power. and through a dc converter. No dc generator
or battery is provided. An additional transformer
modifies generator power to 26-vac power for the
operation of certain equipment. Eight buses serve to
distribute power to the various electrical units. An
airstream-operated emergency generator prOVides
electrical power to essential equipment in the event of
main generator or engine failure. External power can
be used to energize the system through an external
power receptacle located in the lower forward plating
of the left-hand wing root. Operation of the electrical
system is completely automatic, with the exception of
the emergency generator, which must be activated by
the pilot upon failure of the main generator. (Refer
to section V for emergency operation of the electrical
system, and figure FO-5 for schematic presentation
of normal and emergency electrical power
distribution.)

Main Generator
The generator is driven at a constant speed of
8000 rpm over the entire operating range of the engine
from idle to maximum power by the constant speed
drive unit. A test unit may be plugged into the receptacle
on the fuse panel in the nosewheel well to ascertain
that the generator is operating within prescribed
limits. An underfrequency protector (all A-4F,
A-4E reworked per A-4 AFC 338) is connected
between the output of the main generator and the voltage
regulator to prevent the supply of low frequency
power to electronic equipment during engine shutdown
or constant speed drive malfunction.
External Power Switch
When the external power switch is in the EXTERNAL
position, the aft monitored bus is disconnected from
the main generator and is connected to the external
power receptacle, so that power from an external
source may be applied to the system. The external
power receptacle door cannot be closed when the
switch is in the EXTERNAL position.
Emergency Generator
The emergency generator, rated at 1.7 kva, is
carried in a compartment in the lower right-hand
side of the forward fuselage. When the generator is
released into the airstream, a variable pitch propeller
governs the speed of the generator at approximately
12,000 rpm to provide 400-cycle power to the
primary and monitored primary buses.

EMERGENCY GENERATOR BYPASS SWITCH
An emergency generator bypass switch labeled
NORMAL-BYPASS is located in the right-hand
console (figures FO-l and FO-2). If the emergency
generator is extended, placing this switch in BYPASS
allows the pilot to return to main generator operation
prOViding main generator power has been
regained.

EMERGENCY GENERATOR RELEASE HANDLE
The emergency generator release T-handle (figures
1- 5 and 1- 6) on the extreme right side of the
cockpit, above the right console, provides control of
the emergency electrical system in the event of main
generator failure. When the handle is pulled, the
emergency generator drops into the airstream, the
main generator becomes disconnected from the electrical
system, and the primary and monitored primary
bus are connected to the emergency generator.
The emergency generator bypass switch must be in
the NORMAL position.
NOTE
Electrical power will be provided by the
emergency generator only if the emergency
generator bypass switch is in NORMAL.
Once the emergency generator is extended, there is
no way to retract it to the normal stowed position
while in flight.

AC Power Distribution

NORMAL AC POWER

Power from the main generator is sampled by a voltage
regulator. The voltage regulator maintains a
constant voltage output from the main generator by
varying the current in the generator exciter field.
The voltage-regulated power moves through the
INTERNAL position of the external power switch.

EMERGENCY AC POWER

Extending the emergency generator into the airstream
breaks the main generator exciter field circuit, rendering
the main generator inoperative, and transfers
the primary bus and monitored primary bus from the
aft monitored bus to the emergency generator (figure
FO-5). If either the horizontal stabilizer manual
override lever or the AMAC SYS EMER PWR switch
is actuated while operating on emergency generator,
the monitored primary bus will be lost as all emergency
generator power is diverted to the primary
bus. Upon releasing the manual override, or
returning the AMAC SYS switch to the NORM position,
power is again directed to the monitored primary bus.

DC Power Distribution

The primary bus supplies 115/200-vac, 3-phase,
400-cycle ac power to a single dc converter, which
converts the ac power to 28-vdc power, and powers
both the 28-vdc primary bus and the monitored dc
bus.


Figure FO-5 shows the electrical system.

gyrovague's notes&observations of avSimpleElectricSystem device:
This simple system provides two AC power sources and two DC power sources. It
seems like the two AC power sources are based on emulated generators connected
to the left and right engines, and the 2nd AC is always 0 for the A-4E (having no second engine...)
The AC voltage is either 115 or 0 (depending on 1 or 0 supplied to AC_Generator_x_on() as
well as corresponding engine RPM)

The first DC bus gives 28V if either of the AC sources is 115VAC, and 0 otherwise, so would
appear to emulate an AC-to-DC converter output. The second DC bus is indepedent of the
AC, and goes to 0 if DC_Battery_on(0) is called.

From DLL exports inspection, these are the methods support by avSimpleElectricSystem:
AC_Generator_1_on   <- pass true or false to this to enable or disable
AC_Generator_2_on   <- pass true or false to this to enable or disable
DC_Battery_on       <- pass true or false to this to enable or disable
get_AC_Bus_1_voltage  <- returns 115 if enabled (and left engine running), otherwise 0
get_AC_Bus_2_voltage  <- returns 115 if enabled (and right engine running), otherwise 0
get_DC_Bus_1_voltage  <- returns 28 if either AC bus has 115V, otherwise 0
get_DC_Bus_2_voltage  <- returns 28 if battery enabled, otherwise 0
