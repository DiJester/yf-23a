##### Reference Knowledge

###### about jet engine
- Military Power throttle setting: between 0.9-0.95 full throttle
- Compressor efficiency: >85% for advanced engines
- Turbine efficiency: 80% ~ 90%, or higher
- Nozzle efficiency: 90% ~ 98% or higher
- Fan efficiency: 70% ~ 90%, or higher
- a typical single stage compressor's  pressure ratio at sealevel is 1.3 ~ 1.5. For a 9 stages compressors, its over all pressure ratio is 1.4^9 = 26.98
